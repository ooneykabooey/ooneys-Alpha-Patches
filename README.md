# A Better Alpha Experience

### This mod is made for Minecraft Alpha 1.1.2_01.

This mod serves to provide an accessible alpha experience, without compromising on any vanilla features. Mainly back-porting utility features or giving niche features more use (Furnace Minecart).

If you wish to have less tweaks than what the latest has, consider downgrading to an older version of this mod.

## Purpose

Personally, I created this as a way for me to get into Minecraft modding. I mainly work in Java, and what better way to use some of this experience than to work with the most popular Java program ever made! Besides, I've been playing Minecraft since this time, but I was very young. This project, I can say, has definitely revitalized my love for the simpler times of this game. It allows me to be creative in a different aspect, and I believe mod-making gives me way way way way more possibilities than the constraints of Alpha Minecraft's block palette.

# Good Day.
